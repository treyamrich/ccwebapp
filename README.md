## About

This is a volunteer opportunity discovery platform. Its main focus is to facilitate the process of volunteering
for the residents of the island **Oahu**. 
Compassion Connection is an organization whose founder is Timothy Newton. For more information,
visit https://www.compassionconnectionoahu.org/about.
I, the developer, Trey Amrich, decided to pick this project up because I wanted to make a difference at
home, even though I am currently studying at Seattle University.
